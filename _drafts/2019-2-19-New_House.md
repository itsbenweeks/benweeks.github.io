Oh look. Here's another development. I finally bit the bullet 
and bought a house for myself. It took a fair amount of doing, 
but I was able to secure a two-family in Malden, MA. What does 
that mean? Well, mainly that I've been getting my hands dirty 
and fixing it. I can't say that I anticipated everything that 
it entailed, but at least I've been putting in the work. 

As a millenial that suffered through the previous recession without 
substantive income, that means I had to make this concession. Would 
I have loved to live in new construction? Sure! And I could have if 
I had decided to move into a deeper suburb. That's not what I 
decided to do, though. Instead, I bought a house in Malden.

I was able to find a house at a reasonable amount of money. I'm 
not sure entirely about the previous owner's situation. Let's 
just say that it was a family house, and the family was having 
trouble meeting the commitments of ownership. That's right, this 
is a unique fixer-upper opportunity. Almost immediately, I decided 
to get to work and start improving the upstairs unit. Now, I'm not 
a licensed contractor. Most of my improvements were just cosmetic, 
and any major work had the help of the appropriate persons.
