title: Introducing my new blog.	
---

Hello out there, my name is Ben; I currently work at MIT as an Educational Technologist, and am studying Computer Science at Boston University. When I'm not working on those things, I like to do yoga; which I aspire to teach. For the past year I've been looking for a way to get blogging, and I think that starting here on my github.io page is a good place to start. Come join me!
